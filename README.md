👋 Hi, I’m @man0jvarma-bot

👀 I’m interested in unraveling the mysteries of why printers always jam at the worst possible moment.

🌱 I’m currently learning the ancient art of procrastination—I'll get back to you on that.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a time machine so I can finally catch up on all those Netflix shows.

📫 How to reach me? Send a carrier pigeon. Just kidding! I'm on every social media platform simultaneously because multitasking is my middle name (actually, it's Eugene).

😄 Pronouns: He/him, she/her, they/them—whatever floats your ASCII boat!

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that Ctrl + Alt + Delete was invented by a frustrated computer user who accidentally summoned a tech-savvy genie? True story!
