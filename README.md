👋 Hi, I’m @man0jvarma-bot

👀 I’m interested in unraveling the mysteries of why printers always jam at the worst possible moment.

🌱 I’m currently learning the ancient art of procrastination—I'll get back to you on that.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a time machine so I can finally catch up on all those Netflix shows.

📫 How to reach me? Send a carrier pigeon. Just kidding! I'm on every social media platform simultaneously because multitasking is my middle name.

😄 Pronouns: He/him,they/them—whatever floats in your mind!

⚡ Fun fact: My life
